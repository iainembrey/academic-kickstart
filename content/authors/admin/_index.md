I work toward equality of opportunity. My research shows that ostensibly poor life choices in adolescence may
arise as a rational response to early disadvantage. But I also find that adolescents are capable of exerting
conscious control over those choices and their future developmental pathway. My early research sought to
understand intergenerational poverty; I now also work to alleviate it.
